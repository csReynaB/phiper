# Contributing to phiper

This outlines how to propose a change to phiper.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the
documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the
changes are made in the *source* file. This generally means you’ll need
to edit [roxygen2
comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`,
not a `.Rd` file. You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by
reading the comment in the first line.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it’s a good idea to first file an
issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. If
you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a
minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also
help you write a unit test, if needed). See our guide on [how to create
a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more
advice.

### Pull request process

- Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven’t done
  this before, we recommend using
  `usethis::create_from_github("Polymerase3/phiper", fork = TRUE)`.

- Install all development dependencies with
  `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes
  R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. If R CMD check doesn’t
  pass cleanly, it’s a good idea to ask for help before continuing.

- Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using
  `usethis::pr_init("brief-description-of-change")`.

- Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running
  `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser. The
  title of your PR should briefly describe the change. The body of your
  PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.

- For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md`
  (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in
  <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.

### Versioning (pre-1.0.0)

We follow semver with pre-1.0.0 rules:

- **Breaking changes** (API changes or behavior changes that require
  user updates) =\> **minor** bump (e.g. `0.1.0` -\> `0.2.0`).
- **Non-breaking changes** (features, fixes, refactors, docs) =\>
  **patch** bump (e.g. `0.2.3` -\> `0.2.4`).

Each PR should include the appropriate version bump in `DESCRIPTION` and
a matching entry in `NEWS.md`.

### Code style

- New code should follow the tidyverse [style
  guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). You can use
  [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) to apply this style, but
  please don’t restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.

- We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with
  [Markdown
  syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html),
  for documentation.

- We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for
  unit tests. Contributions with test cases included are easier to
  accept.

### Naming conventions

#### Source files (`R/`)

Each analysis domain is split across exactly two files:

| File                 | Purpose                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `<domain>_compute.R` | Statistical computation functions |
| `<domain>_plots.R`   | Visualisation functions           |

Current domains: `alpha`, `beta`, `delta`, `pop`. Shared helpers live in
`utils.R`, `plot_utils.R`, and `zzz.R`.

Test files mirror source files: `tests/testthat/test-<domain>_compute.R`
and `test-<domain>_plots.R`.

#### Function names

| Kind | Convention | Example |
|----|----|----|
| Exported user-facing | `snake_case` verb + noun | `compute_alpha`, `plot_enrichment_counts` |
| Internal helper (phiper) | `.ph_<noun>` | `.ph_peplib_on_main` |
| Internal helper (phiperio, copied) | `.ph_<noun>` | `.ph_abort`, `.ph_with_timing` |
| S3 method | `<generic>.<class>` | `print.phip_data` |

Key rules: - All internal helpers must start with `.ph_` — this makes
them easy to grep and clearly distinguishes them from exported
functions. - Exported functions never start with a dot. - Avoid `phip_`
prefixes for new exports; that convention was retired when the phiperio
split happened (0.3.0). Use plain descriptive names instead.
