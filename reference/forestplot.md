# Forest Plot of Top/Bottom Raw Stouffer T by Rank

Builds a forest plot highlighting the most extreme positive and negative
DELTA/Stouffer statistics within a chosen rank. The plot shows the top
`n_pos_each` features on the positive side and the top `n_neg_each`
features on the negative side, ordered by the selected statistic
(`statistic_to_plot`). This provides a compact summary of which features
shift most strongly between the two groups for a given rank.

## Usage

``` r
forestplot(
  results_tbl,
  rank_of_interest,
  statistic_to_plot = c("T", "T_stand", "Z_from_p"),
  n_neg_each = 15,
  n_pos_each = 15,
  filter_significant = "none",
  sig_level = 0.05,
  left_label = "More in group1",
  right_label = "More in group2",
  arrow_length_frac = 0.35,
  label_x_gap_frac = 0.06,
  y_pad = 0.6,
  label_y_offset = 0,
  label_vjust = -0.3,
  arrow_color = "red",
  arrow_linewidth = 0.6,
  arrow_head_length_mm = 3,
  use_diverging_colors = FALSE,
  base_text_pt = 12,
  font_family = "Montserrat",
  seg_width = 1.2,
  point_size = 3.6,
  show_grid = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- results_tbl:

  Data frame/tibble with at least:
  `rank, feature, group1, group2, design, T_obs, p_perm`.

- rank_of_interest:

  Character scalar specifying the rank to plot (e.g., `"species"`).

- statistic_to_plot:

  Which statistic to rank/plot: `"T"` (raw `T_obs`), `"T_stand"`
  (permutation-standardized), or `"Z_from_p"` (signed Z from permutation
  p).

- n_neg_each:

  Number of most negative features to show. Default 15.

- n_pos_each:

  Number of most positive features to show. Default 15.

- filter_significant:

  Column name to filter on, or `"none"` to disable filtering. If the
  column is numeric, keep rows where `col <= sig_level`.

- sig_level:

  Significance threshold used when `filter_significant` is numeric.
  Default 0.05.

- left_label:

  Text for the left arrow/side label.

- right_label:

  Text for the right arrow/side label.

- arrow_length_frac:

  Fraction of max \\\|T\|\\ used as half-length of arrows.

- label_x_gap_frac:

  Horizontal gap for arrow labels beyond arrow tips (fraction of max
  \\\|T\|\\).

- y_pad:

  Vertical padding above the top category for arrows/labels (y-axis
  units).

- label_y_offset:

  Additional vertical offset for arrow-end labels (y-axis units).

- label_vjust:

  Vertical justification for arrow labels (passed to `annotate()`).

- arrow_color:

  Arrow/label color.

- arrow_linewidth:

  Arrow line width.

- arrow_head_length_mm:

  Arrow head length in mm.

- use_diverging_colors:

  Logical; if `TRUE`, lines/points are shaded blue (negative) to red
  (positive) with higher contrast; otherwise monochrome.

- base_text_pt:

  Base text size in points for the plot.

- font_family:

  Font family for plot text.

- seg_width:

  Segment line width for the horizontal bars.

- point_size:

  Point size for feature markers.

- show_grid:

  Logical; show major/minor grid lines.

## Value

A list with:

- `data` - tibble used for plotting (selected top/bottom items),

- `plot` - ggplot object.

## Details

The y-axis lists feature names (sorted by the chosen statistic), and the
x-axis shows the signed effect size for each feature. Each feature is
drawn as a horizontal segment from zero to its statistic value, with a
point at the end of the segment. A dashed vertical line marks zero to
separate negative from positive shifts. The subtitle reports the
contrast (group1 vs group2) and how many negative/positive features are
shown.

If `use_diverging_colors = TRUE`, segments/points are colored by
magnitude on a blue-to-red scale (negative to positive), otherwise a
single color is used. The arrow annotations at the top label the
direction of enrichment for each group and help interpret the sign of
the statistic.

`statistic_to_plot` controls the statistic used for both ranking and
plotting: raw `T_obs`, permutation-standardized `T_obs_stand`, or
`Z_from_p` (signed Z from permutation p-values). For calibrated
inference or cross-figure comparability, prefer permutation Z-based
results or T_stand.

## Examples

``` r

# in this example we mock the output of compute_delta with a simple
# data.frame - it works the same
set.seed(1)
n <- 20
results_tbl <- data.frame(
  rank = rep("species", n),
  feature = paste0("feat_", seq_len(n)),
  group1 = "control",
  group2 = "treated",
  design = "case-control",
  T_obs = rnorm(n, sd = 2),
  p_perm = runif(n),
  T_obs_stand = rnorm(n),
  Z_from_p = qnorm(1 - runif(n) / 2) * sign(rnorm(n))
)

out <- forestplot(
  results_tbl,
  rank_of_interest = "species",
  statistic_to_plot = "T",
  n_neg_each = 5,
  n_pos_each = 5,
  left_label = "More in control",
  right_label = "More in treated",
  use_diverging_colors = TRUE,
  font_family = "sans"
)

print(out$plot)
```
